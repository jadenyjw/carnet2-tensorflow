# carnet2
Second version of carnet, an autonomous Arduino car. This repository hosts the control code as well as the supervised learning procedures for [this](https://github.com/jadenyjw/carnet2-arduino) Arduino car. To run this program, edit the parameters in `drive.py` and run it. Once enough training data has been collected, run `train.py` to train.
